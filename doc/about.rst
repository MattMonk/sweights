About
=====

``sweights`` is a package which can implement various different methods for projecting out a particular component in a control variable based on the distribution in a discriminating variable. It is based on the work described in `arXiv:2112.04574 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.04574>`_.

For a basic tour of what the package does then see the tutorial_.

The intention is to eventually port this package to `scikit-hep <https://scikit-hep.org>`_.
