We provide several tools for projecting component weights ("sweights") in a control variable(s) using a discriminating variable(s), this includes using the traditional `sPlot` method and also Custom Orthogonal Weight functions (COWs). For details of these please see [Dembinski, Kenzie, Langenbruch, Schmelling - arXiv:2112.04574](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.04574) - published as [NIM A **1040** (2022) 167270](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168900222006076?via%3Dihub).

We also provide tools for correcting the covariance matrix of fits to weighted data. For details please see [Dembinski, Kenzie, Langenbruch, Schmelling - arXiv:2112.04574](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.04574) (Sec IV) and [Langenbruch - arXiv:1911.01303](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01303).
